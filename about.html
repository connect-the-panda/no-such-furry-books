                    <h3>Our Story</h3>
                    <p>No Such Furry Books is an independent children's book press dedicated to creating stories that matter. We believe that the best children's books don't just entertain—they help young readers understand themselves and the world around them.</p>

                    <p>In a world where children face increasingly complex emotional landscapes, we're committed to publishing books that naturally weave social-emotional learning into engaging, character-driven narratives. No lectures, no heavy-handed lessons—just authentic stories about real feelings, meaningful friendships, and the everyday adventures of growing up.</p>

                            <h4>Emotional Intelligence Matters</h4>
                            <p>We create stories that help children recognize, understand, and manage their emotions through relatable characters and situations. Social-emotional learning happens best when it's embedded naturally in compelling narratives.</p>

                            <p>Every book we publish meets professional standards for writing, illustration, and design. We invest in editing, professional illustration, and quality production to ensure our books compete with traditional publishers.</p>

                            <p>Children deserve to see themselves in books and to encounter experiences different from their own. We're committed to authentic representation that reflects the real, diverse world kids live in.</p>

                    <h3>Our Approach</h3>
                    <p>As an indie press, we have the freedom to take creative risks and focus on niche areas underserved by traditional publishing. We're particularly passionate about:</p>
                    <ul class="approach-list">
                        <li><strong>Social-Emotional Learning:</strong> Books that explore feelings, empathy, self-regulation, and relationship skills through storytelling rather than didactic lessons</li>
                        <li><strong>Character-Driven Fiction:</strong> Stories where emotional intelligence and creative problem-solving emerge naturally through character actions and authentic situations</li>
                        <li><strong>Authentic Representation:</strong> Diverse characters experiencing universal emotions and adventures, with cultural details woven naturally into stories</li>
                        <li><strong>Age-Appropriate Content:</strong> Carefully crafted word counts, narrative structures, and illustration styles matched precisely to each age range</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="future-section">
                    <h3>What's Next</h3>
                    <p>We're currently developing our first titles across multiple age ranges—from picture books for ages 3-8 to middle grade novels for ages 8-12. Each book is being crafted with professional editing, quality illustration, and careful attention to both educational value and storytelling excellence.</p>
