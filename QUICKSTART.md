## Remember

**From Your Research:**
> "Authors earning sustainable income publish 20+ titles over 5-7 years, invest $5,000-10,000 per professional book, diversify formats across print/audio/digital simultaneously, pursue bulk institutional sales through schools and libraries, license subsidiary rights, and think like publishers managing backlist revenue rather than chasing single bestsellers."

**This is a marathon, not a sprint!**
- Focus on quality over speed
- Build your email list consistently
- Create a series (3-5 books minimum) for sustainable income
- Invest in professional production values
- Market to adult gatekeepers (parents, teachers, librarians)
